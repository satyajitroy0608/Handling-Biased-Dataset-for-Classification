# Handling-Biased-Dataset-for-Classification
This is classification problem based on Credit Card Fraud Detection. ANN has been used

The dataset has approximately 550 times more number of 0's as compared to 1's

Due to this, there is a high chance of the model being biased towards classifying the data as 0

This problem is handled using customised weights and then making use of ANN

The accuracy gets improved by approximately 5% from 92% to 97% after handling the bias using customised weights
